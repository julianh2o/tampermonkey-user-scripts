A collection of tampermonkey scripts for various sites.

You can find Tampermonkey here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en

These scripts should also work on Greasemonkey if it's still around and may even work on Chrome if they ever end up supporting the @require directive.
